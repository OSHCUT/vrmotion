1. Motion sim project is in the CSharp Examples folder (I know, I know, I'm lazy)
2. You have to build the sFoundation DLL before you can build and run the motion sim code
3. That's in /Software/sFoundation Source/sFoundation. Open the solution and build it.
4. The sFoundation.dll file must also be in the output directory of the SimController project, otherwise there will be a missing file execution error.
